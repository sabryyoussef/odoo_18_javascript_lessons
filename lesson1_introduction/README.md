# Lesson 1: Introduction to Odoo 18 & JavaScript

**Objective**:  
- Understand how JavaScript fits into Odoo’s architecture.  
- Get an overview of the lessons ahead.

## Overview

1. **Why JavaScript in Odoo?**  
   Odoo’s front-end uses JavaScript to create interactive views, widgets, and handle user events.  
2. **What’s new in Odoo 18?**  
   - Possible improvements in performance, asset bundling, or modern JavaScript conventions.  
3. **What we’ll cover in this series**  
   - Environment setup  
   - Writing basic JS in Odoo  
   - Creating custom widgets  
   - Data exchange with the backend

## Key Points

- **Front-end vs. Back-end**: Odoo’s back-end is in Python, but the front-end logic often requires JavaScript for responsiveness.  
- **Modules & Assets**: JavaScript files typically live in `static/src/js/`. We’ll see how to structure them.  
- **Lessons Flow**: Each lesson builds on the previous one.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to [Lesson 2: Environment Setup](../lesson2_environment_setup/README.md) to prepare your Odoo 18 environment for coding.
