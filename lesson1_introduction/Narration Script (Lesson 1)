Hello and welcome to the first lesson in our Odoo 18 JavaScript series.
In this video, I'll introduce you to how JavaScript and Odoo work together,
why it's important to understand the front-end of Odoo, and what we'll be
covering in the upcoming lessons.

[Pause or transition to a slide/visual]

Odoo is well-known for its Python-based back-end. However, a lot of user
interaction happens on the front-end. That's where JavaScript comes in,
allowing us to create interactive elements, handle events, and communicate
with Odoo’s back-end via RPC calls or the web framework.

In Odoo 18, we expect some enhancements in performance, possibly new features,
and improved asset management. Throughout this series, we'll learn how to
integrate JavaScript into custom modules, build UI components (widgets), and
exchange data with the server.

Here’s what you can look forward to:
1. Environment setup in Lesson 2.
2. Writing basic JavaScript in Odoo in Lesson 3.
3. Building custom widgets in Lesson 4.
4. Data exchange using RPC calls in Lesson 5.

I’m excited to share these lessons with you. Let’s get started with setting
up our Odoo 18 environment in the next video. See you there!
