Welcome to Lesson 2, where we’ll set up our Odoo 18 environment for
JavaScript development.

[Show environment or terminal setup]

First, make sure you have Python 3, Postgres, and Odoo 18 installed. If you
need guidance on installing Odoo 18, refer to the official documentation
or your preferred installation source. After Odoo 18 is running, we'll activate
developer mode so we can see technical details.

Next, we’ll create a custom module folder. Inside it, we'll add a 'static/src/js'
directory for our JavaScript files. In the module manifest, we'll list the paths
to our JS files under the 'assets' section so Odoo knows where to load them.

Finally, restart Odoo and check your browser console to confirm our JS file is
loaded. A simple console.log statement is enough to verify success.

With our environment ready, we can now move on to actually writing JavaScript
in Odoo. Let’s dive into basic JS usage in Lesson 3.
